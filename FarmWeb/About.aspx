                <h3>
                There is a rich history behind this farm. So rich, why one would say you could fill a whole paragraph with it. You see, it all started when the land was won during a raffle a the Jefferson County Hooverball Tournament in 1932. It had rained that day and there was quite a small turnout. A young drifter had rode the rails into town just that morning. He was in search of the closest automat when he happened by the fairgrounds. That delicious tomato aspic would have to wait, because this young man had a feeling that this dime would be spent on greater things. 
        This is a paragraph about a farm. If I were much of a writer, I'd tell you a story about this farm. A story about life. Yes, this a rich story, with many characters and... barns, many, many barns. You see, life is a lot like a barn. Sometimes its full, sometimes it's empty, sometimes you pay Amish people to come move it down the road. Ah yes, life is like a barn.
